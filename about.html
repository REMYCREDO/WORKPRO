            <p>The idea of creating this music selling website,
                <br>came from the member of this website who contributed alot in<br>
                trying to make this website a member of WWW(World Wide Web) from the beginning.<br>
                And we all agreed with his idea and we were all excited to seeing it happen.<br>
                And so that's how we came up with the idea of selling music online<br>
